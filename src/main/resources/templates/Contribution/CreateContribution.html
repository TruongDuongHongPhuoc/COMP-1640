                <h2>Term and Condition</h2>
                <p>As an educational institution committed to fostering academic integrity and excellence, it is
                    imperative
                    to establish a comprehensive long-term policy governing the submission of student work through our
                    website. This policy aims to uphold the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability
                    while
                    ensuring the security and integrity of all submitted files.

                    Purpose:
                    The purpose of this policy is to outline the guidelines and procedures for students when submitting
                    their work through the institution's website. It also aims to provide clarity on the
                    responsibilities of
                    both students and the institution in maintaining academic standards and integrity.

                    Submission Guidelines:
                    a. File Formats: Students are required to submit their work in formats specified by the instructor
                    or as
                    outlined in the assignment guidelines. Commonly accepted formats include PDF, DOCX, or similar
                    standard
                    document formats.
                    b. Naming Conventions: Students must adhere to specific naming conventions provided by the
                    instructor or
                    outlined in the assignment instructions. This helps in efficient organization and tracking of
                    submissions.
                    c. Submission Deadlines: Clear deadlines for file submissions will be communicated to students well
                    in
                    advance. Late submissions may be subject to penalties unless valid reasons are provided and approved
                    by
                    the instructor.

                    Academic Integrity:
                    a. Originality: Students are expected to submit original work that is their own and properly cite
                    any
                    sources used. Plagiarism in any form will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary action.
                    b. Collaboration: Collaboration policies should be clearly stated for each assignment. If
                    collaboration
                    is permitted, students must appropriately acknowledge their contributions and those of others.
                    c. Integrity Violations: Any suspected violations of academic integrity will be thoroughly
                    investigated,
                    and appropriate actions will be taken as per the institution's academic integrity policy.

                    File Security and Privacy:
                    a. Data Encryption: All submitted files will be encrypted to ensure data security and privacy.
                    b. Access Control: Access to submitted files will be restricted to authorized personnel only, such
                    as
                    instructors and designated administrators.
                    c. Data Retention: Submitted files will be retained for a specified period as per the institution's
                    data
                    retention policy. After this period, files may be securely archived or deleted in compliance with
                    relevant regulations.

                    Technical Support:
                    a. Submission Portal: The institution will provide a user-friendly submission portal where students
                    can
                    securely upload their files.
                    b. Technical Assistance: Technical support will be available to assist students in case of any
                    difficulties or issues encountered during the submission process.

                    Feedback and Grades:
                    a. Timely Feedback: Instructors are responsible for providing timely feedback on submitted work,
                    adhering to the established grading timeline.
                    b. Grade Confidentiality: Grades and feedback will be communicated to students in a confidential
                    manner,
                    respecting their privacy and academic standing.

                    Policy Review and Updates:
                    a. Regular Review: This policy will be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to adapt to
                    changes in technology, academic standards, or institutional requirements.
                    b. Stakeholder Input: Input from students, faculty, and other stakeholders will be sought during
                    policy
                    review processes to ensure inclusivity and relevance.

                    Compliance and Enforcement:
                    a. Compliance: All students are expected to comply with this policy as a condition of their
                    enrollment.
                    b. Enforcement: Violations of this policy will be addressed through established disciplinary
                    procedures,
                    which may include academic sanctions or other appropriate measures.
