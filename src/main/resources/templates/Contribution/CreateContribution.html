    <h2>Term and Condition</h2>
    <p class="justify-content-between">As an educational institution committed to fostering academic integrity and
        excellence, it is
        imperative
        to establish a comprehensive long-term policy governing the submission of student work through
        our
        website. This policy aims to uphold the principles of fairness, transparency, and accountability
        while
        ensuring the security and integrity of all submitted files.

        Purpose:
        The purpose of this policy is to outline the guidelines and procedures for students when
        submitting
        their work through the institution's website. It also aims to provide clarity on the
        responsibilities of
        both students and the institution in maintaining academic standards and integrity.

        Submission Guidelines:
        a. File Formats: Students are required to submit their work in formats specified by the
        instructor
        or as
        outlined in the assignment guidelines. Commonly accepted formats include PDF, DOCX, or similar
        standard
        document formats.
        b. Naming Conventions: Students must adhere to specific naming conventions provided by the
        instructor or
        outlined in the assignment instructions. This helps in efficient organization and tracking of
        submissions.
        c. Submission Deadlines: Clear deadlines for file submissions will be communicated to students
        well
        in
        advance. Late submissions may be subject to penalties unless valid reasons are provided and
        approved
        by
        the instructor.

        Academic Integrity:
        a. Originality: Students are expected to submit original work that is their own and properly
        cite
        any
        sources used. Plagiarism in any form will not be tolerated and may result in disciplinary
        action.
        b. Collaboration: Collaboration policies should be clearly stated for each assignment. If
        collaboration
        is permitted, students must appropriately acknowledge their contributions and those of others.
        c. Integrity Violations: Any suspected violations of academic integrity will be thoroughly
        investigated,
        and appropriate actions will be taken as per the institution's academic integrity policy.

        File Security and Privacy:
        a. Data Encryption: All submitted files will be encrypted to ensure data security and privacy.
        b. Access Control: Access to submitted files will be restricted to authorized personnel only,
        such
        as
        instructors and designated administrators.
        c. Data Retention: Submitted files will be retained for a specified period as per the
        institution's
        data
        retention policy. After this period, files may be securely archived or deleted in compliance
        with
        relevant regulations.

        Technical Support:
        a. Submission Portal: The institution will provide a user-friendly submission portal where
        students
        can
        securely upload their files.
        b. Technical Assistance: Technical support will be available to assist students in case of any
        difficulties or issues encountered during the submission process.

        Feedback and Grades:
        a. Timely Feedback: Instructors are responsible for providing timely feedback on submitted work,
        adhering to the established grading timeline.
        b. Grade Confidentiality: Grades and feedback will be communicated to students in a confidential
        manner,
        respecting their privacy and academic standing.

        Policy Review and Updates:
        a. Regular Review: This policy will be periodically reviewed and updated as necessary to adapt
        to
        changes in technology, academic standards, or institutional requirements.
        b. Stakeholder Input: Input from students, faculty, and other stakeholders will be sought during
        policy
        review processes to ensure inclusivity and relevance.

        Compliance and Enforcement:
        a. Compliance: All students are expected to comply with this policy as a condition of their
        enrollment.
        b. Enforcement: Violations of this policy will be addressed through established disciplinary
        procedures,
        which may include academic sanctions or other appropriate measures.
